                <p>Authentication in applications is tough. If you decide to roll your own,
security issues are nearly guaranteed. Most anyone who writes software for a
living will tell you to use something you <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> write; that&rsquo;s battle-tested
and in wide use. Open source is even better; hopefully that many eyes and that
many users will suss out the bugs.</p>
<p>Still, there <em>will be bugs</em>. Which is what I think every time I see a
login page on some device in my home. Who wrote this? Is it even remotely
secure? I definitely don&rsquo;t want to expose this to the internet.</p>
<p>So: let&rsquo;s put something in front of it that can handle authentication for us!
In this case, it&rsquo;s a system which is unauthenticated, but that we want to expose
with auth that says: this person&rsquo;s allowed. The upstream application doesn&rsquo;t
care who they are, just that they&rsquo;re allowed in.</p>
<p>In fact: I don&rsquo;t even want to deal with passwords. I&rsquo;d prefer to authenticate
devices instead.</p>
<p>These are some notes on configuring client-side certificate authentication with
<a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a>, which reverse proxies to an application server.</p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t expect that I&rsquo;ve got everything right here;</em> please <a href="https://github.com/fardog/fardog.io/issues">file an issue</a>
against this repository if you see anything troubling here. Consider this my
notes so that I remember how to do things again.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-client-side-certificate">What is a Client-Side Certificate?</h1>
<p>A client-side certificate is a transport-layer authentication mechanism; it can
be used to verify a user <em>before</em> the application layer. In terms of a web app,
it happens at the &ldquo;S&rdquo; of &ldquo;HTTPS&rdquo;: the client is authenticated when the TLS
handshake occurrs, and <em>not</em> at the HTTP layer that is tunneled over the secure
connection.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Client-authenticated_TLS_handshake">Wikipedia article on TLS</a> explains it better than I ever could. But
the important thing to understand is that when done right, your application can
assume that the information it&rsquo;s receiving is coming from someone who&rsquo;s already
authenticated. In my case, the application doesn&rsquo;t care about that: we&rsquo;re just
using it to ensure only devices I allow may access the application.</p>
<p>For that reason, this article only covers the &ldquo;device may access application&rdquo;
portion; using this method to do full authentication may be covered in a later
article.</p>
<h1 id="creating-the-certificate-authority">Creating the Certificate Authority</h1>
<p>First, you must create a key for your Certificate Authority (CA); this key will
be used to create the server-side certificate, and will sign all client
certificate requests. That&rsquo;s to say: it&rsquo;s the master &ldquo;password&rdquo; for the whole
system. Generate one, and keep it safe.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key <span style="color:#ae81ff">4096</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You&rsquo;ll be asked to encrypt the key with a passphrase. Be sure to note it, as
you&rsquo;ll be asked for it every time you create a new certificate or sign a
client certificate request.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-ca-certificate">Create a CA Certificate</h2>
<p>Next create a CA Certificate; this is the server-side certificate that will be
sent via the TLS server to the client. Note this certificate is specific to the
client-side certs, and is not a replacement for your typical certificate needed
for HTTPS authentication; we&rsquo;ll get to that later.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># sign a certificate for 365 days; replace that number with whatever&#39;s</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># suitable for your application</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl req -new -x509 -days <span style="color:#ae81ff">365</span> -key ca.key -out ca.crt
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You&rsquo;ll be asked a number of questions; here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Note what you&rsquo;ve entered for Country, State, Locality, and Organization;
you&rsquo;ll want these to match later when you renew the certificate.</li>
<li>Do not enter a common name (CN) for the certificate; I&rsquo;m unsure why, but I
had problems when I entered one.</li>
<li>Email can be omitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Renewing a certificate just requires running the same command; to generate a
new certificate. If you need to see what you entered in the old certificate, you
can run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl x509 -in ca.crt -noout -text
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will list all information about the certificate, including the values
mentioned above.</p>
<h1 id="creating-a-client-certificate">Creating a Client Certificate</h1>
<p>Next, a client certificate will be created; it&rsquo;s up to you how you want to
handle these, but remember this is effectively a password, and if you want to
&ldquo;change&rdquo; it, you must revoke the certificate. So, think about how you&rsquo;d like to
handle your authentication: per user, per device?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want a client key first; this is generated in the same manner as the
certificate key; you could even use that one (but don&rsquo;t). Typically, if you had
a number of users, the next two steps would be the ones you&rsquo;d ask them to do,
to create a certificate signing requests for you do sign.</p>
<h2 id="users-create-a-key-and-a-certificate-signing-request">Users: Create a Key, and a Certificate Signing Request</h2>
<p>Create an RSA key, if you don&rsquo;t have one already:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl genrsa -des3 -out user.key <span style="color:#ae81ff">4096</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl req -new -key user.key -out user.csr
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A number of questions will be asked; answer each one, including the
Common Name (CN) and email address. The CSR that&rsquo;s created would be sent to the
CA (an administrator, but in this case probably also yourself) to be signed.</p>
<h1 id="signing-a-csr">Signing a CSR</h1>
<p>A CSR must now be signed by the CA; this is the CA saying &ldquo;I know this person
or device: they are who they say they are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># sign the csr to a certificate valid for 365 days</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl x509 -req -days <span style="color:#ae81ff">365</span> -in user.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial <span style="color:#ae81ff">01</span> -out user.crt
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You&rsquo;ll typically want to increment the serial number with each signing. Once the
certificate expires, a new CSR doesn&rsquo;t need to be recreated; the same one can
be signed, which will create a new certificate tied to that public key.</p>
<p>The signed certificate would be sent back to the user along with the CA cert
(not private key!), for installation on their device.</p>
<h1 id="creating-a-pkcs-12-pfx">Creating a PKCS #12 (PFX)</h1>
<p>Now the signed certifcate must be made installable on a device in a way that
bundles the client keys and certificate. The resultant archive is effectively
a password, so it must be kept as safe as the other private keys.</p>
<p>To create the pfx:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl pkcs12 -export -out user.pfx -inkey user.key -in user.crt -certfile ca.crt
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You will be asked to supply an &ldquo;export password&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s very recommended that
one is set, since often you&rsquo;ll need to transfer the PFX archive to a device such
as your phone; you don&rsquo;t want this sitting in your email without a password on
it.</p>
<p>The PFX archive can now be imported into your web browser. This is pretty neat!
You can see how a process like this can be used to prove identity and create
valid access for a user, without either the administrator (CA) or the user
revealing their private key to one another.</p>
<p>Now, lets look at setting up nginx for certificate auth, with a reverse proxy
to our unauthenticated application.</p>
<h1 id="nginx-setup">nginx Setup</h1>
<p>A minimal <code>nginx.conf</code> that supports certificate auth, http redirected to https
and a reverse proxy would look as follows for a domain <code>example.com</code>. Note that
the HTTPS certificate in this example is provided by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a>. That&rsquo;s not
covered here, but may be in some future post.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;

      proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8080 https://example.com;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Of course, in this example the server running on <code>localhost:8080</code> would <em>not</em>
be exposed to the world; either it&rsquo;d be running on a protected box inside a
local network, or firewalled off from the outside.</p>
<p>Now, when you visit the nginx server, your browser will be prompted for its
client certificate; select the certificate that you installed, and you should
be proxied through to the upstream server. If you visit from a browser without
client certificates installed, you should see a 403 without any sort of prompt.</p>
<h1 id="misc">Misc</h1>
<p>A few additional thoughts:</p>
<p>I documented this process because it&rsquo;s easily forgettable, and a hassle to
re-figure when you forget and it&rsquo;s time to renew your certs. A thing I&rsquo;d like
to spend more time on in the future is a tool to make this process easier for
folks.</p>
<p>This document assumes a lot, and also assumes that you know <em>something</em> before
coming in; don&rsquo;t assume that following this document will give you a secure
setup! I might not even be correct in what I&rsquo;m doing!</p>
<p>Have fun, stay safe.</p>
