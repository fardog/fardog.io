I haven&rsquo;t found many in-depth reviews for this machine, and while this certainly won&rsquo;t be &ldquo;in-depth&rdquo; it&rsquo;ll hopefully give some insights into how it handles for regular use if you&rsquo;re at all on the fence.
This was purchased to replace my old-ish X1 Yoga Gen 4; I had bought that machine on a super sale, and while it wasn&rsquo;t a bad device exactly it was severely underpowered for my needs—primarily due to the integrated graphics and 4K display—and it rendered it useless for anything even remotely graphics intensive. <a title="Read full article" href=/blog/2022/10/19/lenovo-x13-yoga-gen-3-review/>&rarr;</a></p><h2><a href=/blog/2022/09/09/fix-windows-security-actions-recommended/>Fix Windows Security "Actions Recommended"</a></h2><time datetime=2022-09-09T15:01:54-0700>Sep 9, 2022</time><p>Fix Windows Security "Actions Recommended" on Windows 11, when the dashboard shows all green checkboxes.

This document covers how to get CentOS network interfaces set up so multiple VLANs can co-exist on a single interface in a way that&rsquo;s transparent to KVM guests. <a title="Read full article" href=/blog/2020/11/08/centos-and-kvm-single-interface-multiple-vlans-for-guests/>&rarr;</a></p><h2><a href=/blog/2019/01/01/docker-hub-tag-builds/>Docker Hub Tag Builds</a></h2><time datetime=2019-01-01T12:59:11-0800>Jan 1, 2019</time><p>Docker Hub automatic builds are a great way to keep your Docker images up to date with a git repository, but building sensibly tagged releases isn&rsquo;t very straightforward. It&rsquo;s easy to create ones for a tag (like v4.1.1) but less so to create versioned images, such as:
myimage:4 myimage:4.1 myimage:4.1.1 This means that when you release a v4.1.2, it becomes the new 4 and 4.1. It turns out that you can do this with docker automatic builds. <a title="Read full article" href=/blog/2019/01/01/docker-hub-tag-builds/>&rarr;</a></p><h2><a href=/blog/2018/01/27/docker-read-only-volumes-with-selinux/>Docker Read-Only Volumes with SELinux</a></h2><time datetime=2018-01-27T15:12:15-0800>Jan 27, 2018</time><p>If you use Docker on an SELinux-enabled Linux distribution like Fedora, you may have run into issues mounting host volumes, and are probably aware of the z flag to modify the SELinux label:
docker run --rm -v /var/www/letsencrypt:/var/www/letsencrypt:z nginx What isn&rsquo;t made very clear from the Docker docs is that you can specify multiple flags separated with commas, say ro,z to specify SELinux labeling and read-only:

Here&rsquo;s what I came up with.
This example is a container running nginx, which has access to letsencrypt certificates, but could be adapted to any service. I&rsquo;ve annotated lines below:
[Unit] Description=nginx (Docker) # start this unit only after docker has started After=docker.service Requires=docker.service [Service] TimeoutStartSec=0 Restart=always # The following lines start with '-' because they are allowed to fail without # causing startup to fail. <a title="Read full article" href=/blog/2017/12/30/running-docker-containers-with-systemd/>&rarr;</a></p><h2><a href=/blog/2017/12/30/client-side-certificate-authentication-with-nginx/>Client-Side Certificate Authentication with nginx</a></h2><time datetime=2017-12-30T17:20:00-0700>Dec 30, 2017</time><p>Authentication in applications is tough. If you decide to roll your own, security issues are nearly guaranteed. Most anyone who writes software for a living will tell you to use something you didn&rsquo;t write; that&rsquo;s battle-tested and in wide use.

Still, there will be bugs.

Sure, if your chosen listening application already supports it, you&rsquo;re set. Otherwise you&rsquo;re left out.
A solution seemed simple: node.js has streams, and they&rsquo;re awesome! Take system audio, pipe it to an encoder, pipe that to an HTTP response, and tell the Chromecast where to look. Easy!
Except, there&rsquo;s no node.js package that supports OS X audio input, except via bindings to another library. <a title="Read full article" href=/blog/2014/09/26/mac-os-x-audio-in-node.js-and-a-chromecast/>&rarr;</a></p><h2><a href=/blog/2014/04/07/xkcd-password-generation-for-node.js/>XKCD Password Generation for Node.js</a></h2><time datetime=2014-04-07T17:30:00-0700>Apr 7, 2014</time><p>I created an XKCD-style password generator for Node.js (see this comic for reference).
