While replacing it, I wanted to make an update to my previous blog post about FDS belts, since my old article wasn&amp;rsquo;t as helpful as I&amp;rsquo;d have liked when I actually tried to use it.
First, there&amp;rsquo;s now a far better repair article available at the Famicom Disk System website. This goes through the whole process of belt replacement as well as aligning the spindle hub, which I had a lot of problems with this time.</description></item><item><title>Fixing a Famicom Disk System</title><link>https://fardog.io/blog/2010/03/21/fixing-a-famicom-disk-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2010 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fardog.io/blog/2010/03/21/fixing-a-famicom-disk-system/</guid><description>Update 2013-10-08: There is now a great article available at the Famicom Disk System site, which I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend. See my addendum for more info.
This isn’t the usual fare from this blog, but this is good information that took me quite some time to find. I’m also an avid video game collector, and i recently picked up a Sharp Twin Famicom and a few Famicom Disk System games; notably Kid Icarus and the infamous Doki Doki Panic!</description></item></channel></rss>
