Error detected while processing ~/.vim/bundle/vim-sensible/plugin/sensible.vim: line 75: E484: Can&amp;#39;t open file /tmp/v1NmKg8/0 Press ENTER or type command to continue Frustratingly, line 75 held no obvious suggestions. After some time troubleshooting, I found it worked fine if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using fish shell.</description></item><item><title>Simple 'workon' Command for fish shell</title><link>https://fardog.io/blog/2013/02/15/simple-workon-command-for-fish-shell/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2013 00:15:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fardog.io/blog/2013/02/15/simple-workon-command-for-fish-shell/</guid><description>I put together a quick workon clone for the fish&amp;rsquo;s fish shell. Definitely nothing as complete or useful as virtualenvwrapper, but it fixes my need: switching simply between virtualenv&amp;rsquo;s and projects.
Installation First, create a function file ~/.config/fish/functions/workon.fish with this defintion:
function workon -d &amp;#34;Activate virtual environment in $WORKON_HOME&amp;#34; set tgt {$WORKON_HOME}/$argv[1] if [ -d $tgt ] cd $tgt # deactivate any active venv, and activate the target # this needs to be rewritten with the `type` fish command if test -n &amp;#34;$VIRTUAL_ENV&amp;#34; deactivate end .</description></item></channel></rss>
