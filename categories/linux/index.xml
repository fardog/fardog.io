Not because it was particularly difficult, but because the documentation was poor.
Below are my full configuration files that were required. The WiFi USB dongle itself was an Adafruit USB WiFi with Antenna which is actually a B-LINK BBL-LW05-AR5; notable becuase of its sizeable antenna, and for working with the latest Raspbian Wheezy distribution.</description></item><item><title>vim, fish shell, and vim-sensible</title><link>https://fardog.io/blog/2013/03/22/vim-fish-shell-and-vim-sensible/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 00:07:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fardog.io/blog/2013/03/22/vim-fish-shell-and-vim-sensible/</guid><description>Part of this evening was spent making vim workable for me, the first step was getting some sane defaults. vim-sensible was recommended in several places (as was Tim Pope&amp;rsquo;s also excellent pathogen), but immediately after installation I was getting an error:
Error detected while processing ~/.vim/bundle/vim-sensible/plugin/sensible.vim: line 75: E484: Can&amp;#39;t open file /tmp/v1NmKg8/0 Press ENTER or type command to continue Frustratingly, line 75 held no obvious suggestions. After some time troubleshooting, I found it worked fine if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using fish shell.</description></item><item><title>Using Caps-Lock as a Compose key in XFCE4</title><link>https://fardog.io/blog/2013/02/22/using-caps-lock-as-a-compose-key-in-xfce4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2013 14:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fardog.io/blog/2013/02/22/using-caps-lock-as-a-compose-key-in-xfce4/</guid><description>Why not take that useless key, and make it useful? The Compose Key—formerly present on many Unix keyboards of old—isn&amp;rsquo;t present on most modern laptops.
In XFCE, this is a little more cumbersome than Gnome, since there isn&amp;rsquo;t a graphical interface for setxkbmap, but these two commands will swap the Caps lock for a compose key:
setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps # disables caps lock setxkbmap -option compose:caps # sets caps key to compose To make this active at login, you can add two entries to your &amp;ldquo;Session and Startup&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Application Autostart&amp;rdquo; available under the Settings Manager.</description></item></channel></rss>
