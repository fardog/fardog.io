      <description>My old Sharp Twin Famicom threw the belt again, as they do. While replacing it, I wanted to make an update to my previous blog post about FDS belts, since my old article wasn&amp;rsquo;t as helpful as I&amp;rsquo;d have liked when I actually tried to use it.
First, there&amp;rsquo;s now a far better repair article available at the Famicom Disk System website. This goes through the whole process of belt replacement as well as aligning the spindle hub, which I had a lot of problems with this time.</description>
