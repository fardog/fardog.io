If you decide to roll your own, security issues are nearly guaranteed. Most anyone who writes software for a living will tell you to use something you didn&amp;rsquo;t write; that&amp;rsquo;s battle-tested and in wide use. Open source is even better; hopefully that many eyes and that many users will suss out the bugs.
Still, there will be bugs. Which is what I think every time I see a login page on some device in my home.</description></item></channel></rss>
