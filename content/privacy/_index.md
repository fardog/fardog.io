# Android Applications

For Android applications, I don't collect any data.

For apps installed through the Google Play Store, Google does collect some data
automatically, such as the number of installations, and the countries, Android
versions, and similar data about devices it is installed on. I don't share this
data in any way, but I have no idea what Google does with it.
