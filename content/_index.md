Hi. I'm Nat Wittstock, and you've found my little web page. I'm a
software engineer. I spend my days at [Airship][ua], working wherever I'm
needed. In my spare time, some [projects][] have happened. I write Typescript,
Go, and Python, typically.

If you need to reach me, you can [try these methods][contact].

The name "fardog" comes from a friend of a friend who did an impression of a
"far dog", making tiny "haroo" noises. I liked how it implied [space dogs][],
and adopted the name for my web design company; that's long defunct, but the
username stuck around.
