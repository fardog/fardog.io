Hi. I'm Nathan Wittstock, a software developer from Portland, Oregon. You've
found my little web page. I spend my days at [Urban Airship][ua], working on our
customer dashboard. In my spare time, some [projects][] have happened. I write
Go, Javascript, and Python, typically.

I'm easiest to reach on [Twitter][] or [Mastodon][].
