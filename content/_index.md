Hi. I'm Nathan Wittstock, a software developer from Portland, Oregon. You've
found my little web page. I spend my days at [Airship][ua], working on our
customer dashboard. In my spare time, some [projects][] have happened. I write
Typescript/Javascript, Go, and Python, typically.

If you need to reach me, you can [try these methods][contact].

I didn't invent the name "fardog"; it comes from a friend of a friend who did an
impression of a "far dog", making tiny "haroo" noises. I adopted it for the name
of my web design company (now defunct) but the username stuck around.
