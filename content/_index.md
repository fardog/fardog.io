Hi. I'm Nathan Wittstock, and you've found my little web page. I'm a software
engineer. I spend my days at [Airship][ua], working wherever I'm needed. In my
spare time, some [projects][] have happened. I write Typescript, Go, and Python,
typically.

If you need to reach me, you can [try these methods][contact].

The name "fardog" comes from a friend of a friend who did an impression of a
"far dog", making tiny "haroo" noises. I liked how it implied [space dogs][],
and adopted the name for my (long defunct) web design company, and the username
stuck around.
