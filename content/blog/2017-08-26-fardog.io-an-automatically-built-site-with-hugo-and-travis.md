Welcome to the new [fardog.io][]: an HTTPS website which is hosted for free,
easy to maintain, and automatically built when I push updates to a git
repository. It's backed by [Hugo][], [Travis-CI][travis], [GitHub][], and
[Cloudflare][].

**Note:** This article is out of date, as Travis-CI retired their open-source
service and I moved the build to [Github Actions][gh-actions]. I'll publish an
update to this article in due time but until then, [this pull
request][actions-pr] will explain the change.

[actions-pr]: https://github.com/fardog/fardog.io/pull/12

Although I don't intend for this article to be a complete how-to of launching a
site like this, hopefully it gives you a basis to piece together how you can
build your own.

# A History

This site is rebuilt from the ashes of milkandtang.com (defunct, now redirects
to this site) with the intention to preserve links to old articles, but
modernize everything else about the setup. The old site was built on
[Octopress][], which—for a non-Ruby developer—was always problematic to build:
it required unfamiliar tooling, installation of packages I didn't otherwise
need, and the typical `gem` and `rvm` foolin' that doesn't feel particularly
worth it when you just want to update a blog post.

# The Requirements

I went in with the following requirements:

* HTTPS hosted
* Staticaly generated
* Built with a familar toolchain
* Old links preserved
* No "build" step; should be published automatically on commit/push

"Free" was not a requirement, but it ended up being (nearly) so due to the
tools/services I chose.

# The Tools

fardog.io is built using the following:

* [Hugo][]: a static-site generator written in [Go][]
* [Travis-CI][travis]: a Continuous Integration (CI) service with a GitHub
  pages publisher out-of-the-box
* [GitHub][]/[GitHub Pages][gh-pages]: the ubiquitous code-hosting platform,
  and their free static-site-hosting service
* [Cloudflare][]: a service which provides a Content-Delivery Network (CDN),
  DNS hosting, and HTTPS termination
* [Amazon S3][]: a file-hosting service; here, it's used to handle redirections
  for the old milkandtang.com domain
* [Amazon Route 53][]: a DNS service; here, used to handle the old
  milkandtang.com domain

Although I pay for many of these services for other reasons, here they are all
used at their "free" tiers, with the exception of the Amazon services; those
cost about $0.53 USD/month, fluctuating slightly based on usage.

# The Build Process

The [code][] for the site is hosted in a public repository on GitHub; this code
contains the raw posts, configuration for Hugo, and the [travis
configuration][travis-conf] which is the declarative file which tells Travis how
to build the static site.

Really, you can learn the most from these two files:

* [`.travis.yml`][travis-conf] the Travis configuration file
* [`config.toml`][hugo-conf] the Hugo configuration file

## Travis Configuration

The Travis configuration is the more interesting configuration; it's embedded
below, with annotations in-line:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/fardog/97abb2bc066cdeada5fbf9fb8e0ed079.js"></script>

The only other information Travis needs is your [GitHub Token][gh-token]; you'll
want to generate one specificaly for this purpose. The
[Travis docs][travis-gh-token] cover what access this token needs to your
account. Once you have that, it just needs to be encrypted and stored in your
`.travis.yml`, which is done with Travis' CLI tools, run in your repository:

```bash
travis encrypt GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_token> --add env.matrix
```

This will encrypt the token, and insert it into your `.travis.yml`.

# Custom Domain Setup

At this point, you should have Travis set up and auto-building your static
site, and posting that build to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, but
not at a custom domain.

Follow the instructions at GitHub: [Setting up a custom domain][gh-domain],
which will direct you create a file in the root of your built site named
`CNAME`. Hugo automatically puts any files in a directory named `static` at the
root of your site; see [my `static` directory][fd-static] for an example.

# HTTPS Setup

By now, your site should be served at your custom domain, but is not yet SSL
protected. It's time to set up your account at [Cloudflare][].

Once you sign up for a free account, Cloudflare will walk you through the
process of setting up your domain and transferring DNS. There are only a few
settings you'll need to change after the fact:

* Crypto > SSL: Change "Full" to "Flexible". This will allow Cloudflare to hit
  GitHub's servers without strict SSL, since its certificates won't match your
  bare domain.
* Crypto > Always use HTTPS: Change to "on". This will redirect all HTTP
  requests to your domain to HTTPS.
* Crypto > Automatic HTTPS Rewrites: Change to "on". This will rewrite any URLs
  that are local to your domain over to HTTPS. Not strictly necessary, but
  allows you to be a little less careful with how you're linking things.
  Ideally, you've got your domain correctly set up in your Hugo config.

With this set up, your site should be available over HTTPS in a short time.

# Amazon Redirect

In order to redirect the existing milkandtang.com, I used Amazon's Route 53 and
S3 site hosting service to redirect all URLs to fardog.io; I won't go into
detail here as it's not the primary interest; Amazon
[maintains a page][s3-redir] on how to set this up.

There's a few things to note:

## Updating YAML Frontmatter

The frontmatter I was using for my Octopress posts needed some small updates. I
changed it from:

```yaml
layout: post
title: Fixing a Famicom Disk System
author: Nate
layout: post
categories:
  - Gaming
tags:
  - Famicom
  - repair
```

…to:

```yaml
title: Fixing a Famicom Disk System
date: 2010-03-21T12:00:00-07:00
categories:
  - Gaming
tags:
  - Famicom
  - repair
```

Specifically, Hugo requires a strict ISO-8601 date, whereas Octopress was more
permissive. URLs appear to be generated in the same manner between the two, so
nothing was changed there.

## Matching URLs

I needed to add the following to my Hugo `config.toml` to the permalinks matched
the previous format:

```toml
[permalinks]
blog = "blog/:year/:month/:day/:title/"
```
