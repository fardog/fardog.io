Some changes are coming; they're changes for me, but a secondary effect is that I no longer have free hosting for some projects that have been in unmaintained-but-still-running status for the last few years. I'm taking the following offline:

- [Adventure](http://adventure.fardo.gs): My "Choose your own adventure"-like story builder. This hasn't seen an update since early 2012; very few people were using it. Re-launching this application would require a considerable effort, so I'm taking this offline for the foreseeable future. It's been backed up, and the source code has been [open sourced](https://github.com/fardog/adventure). If anyone wants to help resurrect this, please contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/milkandtang).
- [Is this DST?](http://isthisdst.us/): My geo-aware single-serving site that lets you know if you're in daylight saving time or not. Similar to above, I'm taking it offline vs the effort to relaunch. Again, [source code is available](https://github.com/fardog/isthisdst). I may get the urge to bring this one back online again.
- [Far Dog LLC](http://www.fardogllc.com): I spun down this LLC a few years ago, the website never had much on it.

Thanks for understanding. Onward!
