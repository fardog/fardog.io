My old [Sharp Twin Famicom][1] threw the belt again, as they do. While replacing it, I wanted to make an update to [my previous blog post][2] about [FDS][3] belts, since my old article wasn't as helpful as I'd have liked when I actually tried to use it.

First, there's now a [far better repair article][4] available at the [Famicom Disk System][5] website. This goes through the whole process of belt replacement as well as aligning the spindle hub, which I had a lot of problems with this time.

I'd recommend following [their article][4] over mine; it does a far better job of explaining how to align the spindle hub. The only addition I would make is that I still had to make small 5â€“10&deg; adjustments both forward and backward to the spindle hub before everything worked.
