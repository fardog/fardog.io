Here's a blend of chai black tea I've been messing with:

* 100g Darjeeling tea
* 70g whole cloves, lightly pulverized to create a mix of fines and pieces
* 40g dried ginger, ground coarsely to 1–2mm pieces
* 32g cinnamon sticks, chipped into 5–7mm length pieces
* 35g black peppercorns
* 18g mixed peppercorns (black, red, green, white)

This makes for a nice clove-heavy blend but it doesn't overpower the tea flavor.
For grinding the spices, I use an attachment for my immersion blender but it's
essentially the same setup as a coffee grinder: spinning blades in a container.
I don't get a very even grind out of it, but the mix of fine particles and
larger pieces sort of works in this case.

For a rooibos blend, I use the same weights of ingredients but replace the 35g
of black peppercorns with mixed peppercorns for a total of 53g.

I'd recommend trying your own blends: you can pick the quality of tea you want,
try teas that are uncommonly used in blends, and tweak it to your tastes.
